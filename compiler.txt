if we put r in front of our row string then it wont be handled in an especial way.

* for example r'\tTAb' ; here \t will not give 8 characters space b/c of r

*[specify the character you wanna match] -->[-.] either hypen or dot

*[89]00 either 800 or 900

*[1-5]--> range b/w 1 and 5  example 2[a-z] ex3 [a-zA-Z] either lower or upper
*[^a-zA-z] it will not match upper case or lower letter
*r[^b]at --> we dont want anything starting with b followed by at


*r['\d{3}]   -> i wanna match 3 of these digits
*(r'Mr\.?')
*? 0 or one . in our example MR.Abdul MR Abdul. question mark will match both of them
* s means space[A-Z]--> look for the space then any capital letter
*\w --> any word character




r[a-zA-Z0-9_]
